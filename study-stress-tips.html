  <ul>
    <li><strong>Break Study Sessions into Small Chunks:</strong> Use techniques like the Pomodoro method—study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Keeps your mind fresh and focused without burning out.</li>
    <li><strong>Set Clear, Achievable Goals:</strong> Write down what you want to accomplish before studying. Small goals make studying feel less overwhelming.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a Quiet, Organized Study Space:</strong> Find a spot free from distractions with all your materials ready. A calm environment helps concentration.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay Hydrated and Eat Balanced Meals:</strong> Drinking enough water and eating nutritious food fuels your brain and energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Regular Physical Breaks:</strong> Stand up, stretch, or walk every hour to reduce stress and refresh focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Deep Breathing or Mindfulness:</strong> Spend a few minutes calming your mind before studying to reduce anxiety and prepare to learn.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Active Study Techniques:</strong> Engage with material by using flashcards, quizzes, or teaching concepts to a friend for better memory.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Last-Minute Cramming:</strong> Plan ahead for exams. Regular review reduces pressure and improves retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk About Your Stress:</strong> Share worries with friends, family, or teachers for support and advice.</li>
    <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7–9 hours nightly, especially during busy periods, for memory and focus.</li>
